How is your project going; have you run into issues? - You must answer this question, as it is the most important part of the text entry portion.

My project is going well as I have made a lot of progress getting the skeleton of the game running. I have run into issues such as small syntax errors,
the food not dissapearing when eaten, and getting the movement speed right. My next focus now that I have gotten the game running will just be checking 
off all the requirements needed.
